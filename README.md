Its main goal is to **standarize and abstract hardware specific configurations** and change your desktop colors
with **+350 different themes** and wallpapers.

You can write some patterns with generic attributes, and then Gtheme will fill those values with the appropriate ones following the selected theme/settings.

The final result you get is that you can change between any desktop of your choice with a **single command**, and change the theme of all applications in a **centralized and automatized way**. Moreover, you can also install desktops from other people who had
already adapted their dotfiles to Gtheme and everything will work just fine.

To sum up, you can try your favourite [Unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) ricings üçö (if authors port them to Gtheme)
